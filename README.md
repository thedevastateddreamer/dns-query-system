# dns-query-system
A Python-based DNS Query System that implements a client-server model. The server processes DNS queries, caches results, and responds with relevant DNS records (A, CNAME, NS). The client sends DNS queries to the server and processes the responses. This system simulates DNS query processing and caching with multi-threading and random delays.
